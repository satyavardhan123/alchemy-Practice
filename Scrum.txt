Scrum:- Scrum is an Agile software development framework that enables a team to communicate and self-organize.
Scrum is a framework for solving problems and completing tasks in increments. 
Developers use it to take on complex projects by breaking them into smaller tasks.

Product Owner: The product owner is responsible for managing the product backlog and ensuring that it is 
prioritized to deliver the most value to the customer. They are the main point of contact for the development 
team and are responsible for communicating the vision and requirements of the product to the team.

Product Backlog: 
The product backlog is a prioritized list of features, requirements, and bugs that need to be addressed in the product.
It is managed by the product owner and is continuously updated and refined throughout the development process.

Scrum Master: The scrum master is basically the project manager on the team, who keeps track of individual and overall progress 
and helps the team achieve maximum efficiency within scrum rules. They perform important functions like holding daily standup meetings, 
hosting sprint planning sessions, assessing team membersâ€™ progress. 

Sprint Backlog : 
A sprint backlog is a subset of the product backlog and lists the work items to complete in one specific sprint. 
The purpose of the sprint backlog is to identify items from the product backlog that the team will work on during the 
sprint.

Sprint :
Sprints are time-boxed periods of one week to one month, during which a product owner, scrum master, and scrum
 team work to complete a specific product addition. During a sprint, work is done to create new features based on 
the user stories and backlog. A new sprint starts immediately after the current sprint ends.

Sprint Retrospective: This is a meeting held at the end of each Sprint where the team reflects on 
their process, identifies what went well and what could be improved, and creates a plan for 
implementing those improvements in the next Sprint
